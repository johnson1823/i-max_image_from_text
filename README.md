# About modification - How it's working?
This modification downloads images from the contents of blog entries, but it is not necessary to add a picture in the content. How it's working?

1. In the first place, the modification downloads all the added images in the content of the entry. 
2. In the case when we have added several pictures, the generator draws the picture that is to be displayed.
3. If there is no image in the content of the entry, then the plugin then checks whether a distinctive image has been added.
4. When an entry image is not added anywhere, a clean entry will be displayed.
